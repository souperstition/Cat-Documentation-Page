# Cat Documentation Page


This was my take on the "technical documentation page" assignment from FCC. It ended up not being very.. technical.. but I am so happy with how it turned out. 

## Screenshots and Live Demo

### Portrait Mode

## Scalability
The assignment required the navigation on the side to always be visible in desktop mode. In order to save screen space on phones, I used a media query to alter the layout for portrait mode. Portrait viewers will get a one column layout with the navigation at the top of the screen. The navigation is collapsible so it doesn't take up more screen space than necessary. Rather than being fixed, it scrolls to the top but can always be accessed via a top button that only appears on mobile devices when scrolled down a certain amount. Font sizes and content scale for different screen sizes so differences are very minimal.

## Visual Aesthetic 
This particular color scheme was chosen using [Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/). Animations were added using the [Animate on Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library.
